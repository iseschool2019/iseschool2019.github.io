            <h2><strong>Abstract:</strong></h2>
            <div class="paper">
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence has the potential to facilitate collaboration and coordination in software development organizations by facilitating access to knowledge, optimizing workflows, and coordinating interdependent work. But in order to have a positive impact, it is essential that intelligent systems are designed to work harmoniously with the naturally-occurring human processes that make groups of people collectively intelligent. This lecture will survey several of the most important of these human processes, including social networks, transactive memory, and sense-making in transparent environments. It will explain how each mechanism works, how it facilitates organizational performance, and how it could potentially be enhanced with smart technologies.

            <div class="paper">
                <p>
                    Creating and running software produces large amounts of data about the development process and the customer usage. This data can be turned into actionable insight with the help of skilled data scientists. In this tutorial I will give a quick introduction into how data scientists work in the software industry. I will discuss my favorite qualitative and quantitative methods that I use during my work by using productivity of software engineers as an example. The tutorial will include hands on exercises on qualitative data analysis as well as data analysis with PowerBI and R.

            <h2><strong>Title:</strong> Data Analytics for Automated Software Engineering</h2>
            <h2><strong>Abstract:</strong></h2>
            <div class="paper">

                Building a working software system is not an easy task. Developers need to spend much effort and resources to ensure that a software is developed well according to a set of functional and non-functional requirements. Quality assurance activities need to be performed to ensure that defects and issues plaguing a system are removed before it is released to the market. These development and quality assurance processes need to be repeated as a software evolves over a long period of time. Due to the complexity of software systems, there is a need for automated tool support to reduce the cost of developing and maintaining systems and increase the reliability of these systems. To address this need, recently data analytics techniques have been used to recover useful and actionable information from passive software data and to convert these into automated tools that can help improve developers' productivity and reduce post-release bugs. Data analytics for automated software engineering is an active research topic that merges software engineering with fields such as data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, natural language processing, and many others. Tools and techniques from these fields are used, extended, specialized, or combined together to recover actionable information from a diverse set of software data. The growth of this new research topic is propelled with the increasing availability of a large amount of software data in the internet stored in source code repositories, discussion forums, blogs, microblogs, bug reporting systems, and many more data sources. This short course introduces participants to this exciting research area.

            <h2><strong>Title:</strong> Using Git And Github Repositories For Research In Software Engineering</h2>
            <h2><strong>Abstract:</strong></h2>
            <div class="paper">
                <p>
                    Git and Github have become fundamental tools in the development process in both open source and commercial development.  The first part of this tutorial will describe how these tools are being used. Specifically, using research literature and sample projects, we will cover how git is used for version control of software artifacts, the different workflows that people use, and how the workflows are affected by the organizational structure of the software development teams. Regarding Github, we will discuss its features, including how it enhances git with a simple-to-use graphical user interface that promotes a "pull request" model of software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second part of the tutorial will cover the fundamentals of retrieving data from both sources (git and Github) for the purpose of scientific research. We will cover their data models and the relationship between the data stored in these repositories and the software development process. We will discuss also how to extract development history from both sources directly and using third-party tools and data sources (such as gh-torrent and the other research data sets).  We will also discuss the perils and challenges of extracting and using information retrieved from both sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of this tutorial students will be able to interpret the information stored in git and github repositories and leverage it in their own research in software engineering.
